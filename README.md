# MPM for 2D Snow in Warp
Submission for my CSC2521 final project. An implementation of the material point method for snow, in 2D, following the algorithm described in Stomakhin, 2013.

## Demos

## Setup
To setup the project, do the following:
1. Clone repository to your computer.
2. Setup a python virtual environment, `python -m venv env`
3. Activate python virtual environment, `source env/bin/activate`
4. Install requirements, `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Future Improvements
* Finalize implementation of the implicit solver.
* Implement moveable collision objects.
